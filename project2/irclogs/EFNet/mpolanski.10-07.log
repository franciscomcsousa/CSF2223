15:08 <carlseaga> Hi Meg!!
15:09 <carlseaga> just finished installing the irc client
15:09 <carlseaga> you dont even know how much nostalgia this brings me
15:09 <MPolanski> hey carl!
15:09 <MPolanski> ikr, we used to talk through here all the time
15:09 <MPolanski> brings back memories of the good old times
15:09 <MPolanski> nowadays no one uses this anymore
15:09 <carlseaga> i mean, its fair, now there are a thousand other apps that are much more practical, like skype and whatsapp
15:10 <MPolanski> thats true
15:10 <carlseaga> anyways, what did you want to tell me? im quite curious...
15:10 <MPolanski> okay, so do you remember our many conversations about the moon landing of 1969?
15:10 <carlseaga> of course i do
15:10 <carlseaga>  i used to be so determined on exposing that fraud
15:10 <MPolanski> yeah, i had to endure so many long rants about how obviously fake it was, and how stupid everyone was for believing it
15:10 <MPolanski> honestly it was scary how passionate you were about that ahahah
15:11 <carlseaga> yeah... but ive given up on that already
15:11 <MPolanski> i was naive in thinking that science could diprove that level of lies
15:11 <MPolanski> you better rekindle that passion then
15:11 <MPolanski> i have something that you might like
15:11 <carlseaga> huh?
15:11 <carlseaga> what is it?
15:12 <MPolanski> i have proof carl
15:12 <MPolanski> proof that the moon landing was fake
15:12 <MPolanski> its not scientific proof, its even better
15:12 <MPolanski> i have secret documents
15:12 <carlseaga> no way
15:12 <carlseaga> youre not joking around with me are you?
15:12 <MPolanski> im not!!
15:12 <MPolanski> i know how important this is for you, i would never lie to you about something like this
15:13 <carlseaga> hhmm

15:13 <MPolanski> do you know my husband?
15:13 <carlseaga> your husband?
15:13 <carlseaga> Chris Cox right?
15:13 <carlseaga> grandson of the ex-president?
15:13 <MPolanski> exactly
15:13 <MPolanski> would you believe me if i told you that i got hold of the letter that Richard Nixon wrote to Chris, telling him that the moon landing was fake?
15:13 <carlseaga> NO WAY
15:14 <MPolanski> yes way ;)
15:14 <carlseaga> but are you fine with leaking that? its your husbands secret
15:15 <MPolanski> dont worry about that, there is no way i wasnt going to share something as important as this with my ol pal

15:48 <MPolanski> Hi again 
15:48 <MPolanski> Have you managed to obtain all the secret files?
15:48 <carlseaga> I am working on it
15:48 <carlseaga> you hid them well
15:49 <MPolanski> sorry about that
15:49 <MPolanski> i had to make sure only you could access them
15:49 <MPolanski> just in case something happened
15:50 <carlseaga> of course
15:50 <carlseaga> i've looked at some of the files and it really is unbelievable
15:50 <carlseaga> how is it possible that all of these documents, all of this proof, was buried for such a long time
15:50 <MPolanski> it really is carl! i couldn't believe it as well.. really makes you wonder on what secrets people can hide
15:51 <MPolanski> but remember that it is really important for you too hide the files
15:51 <MPolanski> we must leave no traces
15:51 <carlseaga> definitely
15:52 <carlseaga> i'll do my best to lay low and hide the files.. but how should i go with it??
15:52 <MPolanski> first off you need to find a way to securely delete them from your pc
15:52 <MPolanski> as well as hide them in a secure mean, like a server
15:52 <MPolanski> the internet will have your answers ;)
15:52 <carlseaga> ok, i'll do so
15:52 <MPolanski> good luck!
15:53 <MPolanski> we're writting history carl, look at us
15:53 <carlseaga> indeed we are..
15:53 <carlseaga> once again, i'm so very grateful meg this is truly something
15:53 <carlseaga> now, i must resist the urge to share it with the world
15:54 <MPolanski> its best if we dont talk for a while now Carl
15:54 <carlseaga> yes
15:54 <MPolanski> see you carl, stay safe
15:55 <carlseaga> you too meg, you too
