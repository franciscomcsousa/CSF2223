Yo VIP let's kick it
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
Alright stop collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say "Hi"
"Did you stop?" No I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead yo
So I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla
Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja cut like a razor blade
So fast other DJs say "Damn!"
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it
Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice
Yo man let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice ice baby too cold
Ice ice baby too cold too cold
Ice ice baby too cold too cold
Ice ice baby too cold too cold
